Llama Assist is a Home Assistant integration that allows you to interact with almost any LLM (Large Language Model)
using the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) backend.

This integration creates a new **Conversation agent** in Home Assistant, which can be selected in the **Voice Assistants**
section of the Home Assistant UI and used to interact with the LLM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is NOT a llama.cpp backend, it connects to an existing llama.cpp backend running on your local network or accessible
> via the internet.

## Features
- Lightweight and fast
- Easy to set up and use
- **Supports any LLMs supported by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)**
- Supports all built-in Home Assistant **Assist** actions
- Additional actions for more advanced interactions _(COMING SOON)_
